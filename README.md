# IrisClassification

This is a quick exploration of simple classification using [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) with Edgar Anderson's famous [Iris data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

The goal of the project is to utilise caret alongside a variety of machine learning algorithms to correctly classify irises into their species group whilst casually comparing the different algorithms.
